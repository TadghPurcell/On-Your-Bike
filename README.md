# On Your Bike: Dublin Bikes Cycle Planner
You can access our web application here: https://onyourbike.info/

## Description
This project developed a standalone web application that provides Dublin Bikes users with real-time occupancy and weather information.

The primary focus was on user experience, with central goal of creating a highly functional and intuitive web page, tailored to the needs of cyclists and commuters in Dublin’s city centre.

The website features a simplistic and straightforward design, with an interactive map of the city. The application logo and name “On Your Bike’ are displayed at the top of the page. 

Real-time weather details appear on the top right-hand corner as an informative feature. A sidebar on the right of the page contains a search panel and essential information, providing users with the ability to plan their journey.

#### Figure 1 - On your bike app features.
- **Interactive Map:** The focal point of the website is an interactive, functional map of Dublin, allowing users to explore bike stations and plan their route efficiently, in a visual manner. Markers for bike stations, and the surrounding landmarks are highlighted across the map, allowing users to zoom in and out of points of interest with ease.

- **Page Header:** A section at the top of the page, conveniently placed above the map provides structure to the page, highlighting the page name, logo and weather details.

- **Weather Details:** Real time weather information is displayed on the page, providing users with insights into the current climate for their planned journey. This feature is visual, concise and informative.

#### Figure 2 - (a) journey planner sidebar with (b) autofill destination HTML form and (c) popup calendar.
- **SideBar Journey Planner:** The inclusion of a side bar allows the user to efficiently plan their journey. This feature includes a HTML form for inputting start and end destinations, along with date and time selectors. The option to open a popup calendar and digital-time visual is also displayed to increase the user experience. 
This feature facilitates seamless journey planning, and access to predicted station availability, all in one place.

![Closest Stations Tab](https://github.com/TadghPurcell/se-group27-project/blob/main/github_imgs/figure_3.png?raw=true "Closest Stations Tab")
#### Figure 3 - Closest stations tab.
- **Closest Stations Tab:** An additional feature of the sidebar is a tab that provides users with information about the closest stations to the user's current location. It provides key information for each station such as walk time, distance and available bikes/stations.

![Station Information Tab](https://github.com/TadghPurcell/se-group27-project/blob/main/github_imgs/figure_4.png?raw=true "Station Information Tab")
#### Figure 4 - Station information tab.
- **Station Information Tab:** Upon clicking on a station, either on the map or in the closest stations tab, the user is greeted with a station information tab. This provides users with extra station details, such as predicted (green) and historic (blue) availability, distance from the user, and walk time. This allows the user to make more informed decisions for their planned journey. Should the user wish to go to this station, they can click the directions  button on the top right, bringing them into the journey planner tab.

![Route Renderer](https://github.com/TadghPurcell/se-group27-project/blob/main/github_imgs/figure_5.png?raw=true "Route Renderer")
#### Figure 5 - User friendly route map and directions sidebar with predicted (green) bike/station availability for that day. Historic data (blue) will also be shown if the trip is being planned for the current day.
- **Journey Route:** Once the user inputs the details of their location and trip, the map adjusts to show a clear layout of the recommended route to take. This leads the user from their current input location, to the nearest bike station with availability. A route plan appears on the map to get the user from starting to end destination efficiently and safely.
